This model is a simplified (so not so heavy, while keeping geometry) model of v1 Yatchy pcb, screen and flex cable.

Notes:
- not the V1.1, if you want a more precise one, just export it from Kicad.
- also the module is included with it
- you might want to add a small offset from the pcb to the screen, as double sided tape is in between. In practice, if your tolerances are right (so, any, small ones) this should just work and be tight
