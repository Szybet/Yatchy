#### 1. Why no spot for the vibration motor?

No place for it really, it was more important to optimise the module area than for the motor. As yatchy is assembled by hand, it can be placed anywhere, or integrated into the side of the case, or just use as a buzzer TLDR: for hackability (both for the choosing of the motor / buzzer up to the way of designing the case, placing it where you want) and other priorities, as the cases I design have enough space (in one battery is on the strap, in the other its simply a brick case) its simply put on top of components
