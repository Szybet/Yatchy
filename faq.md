## Frequently Asked Questions
or at least sometimes

#### 1. Why no spot for the vibration motor?

No place for it really, it was more important to optimise the module area than for the motor. As yatchy is assembled by hand, it can be placed anywhere, or integrated into the side of the case, or just use as a buzzer TLDR: for hackability (both for the choosing of the motor / buzzer up to the way of designing the case, placing it where you want) and other priorities, as the cases I design have enough space (in one battery is on the strap, in the other its simply a brick case) its simply put on top of components

#### What soldering gear do I need?
I don't know, depends on your skill, a madman will need a lighter and a metal rod with some tin ore to do it \s

But seriously, here is my gear I use, but keep in mind:
- It's old, there are for sure better alternatives today
- I'm no expert, so still the point above, there are probably better alternatives (give me some tips if you know better, but look at the point below)
- I prefer, lightly put, to pay less, a lot less when available, but I also prefer long lasting tools. The triangle is my enemy.

- Again, depending on your skill you will need better or worse gear to do the job

So it's a very general guide, something among the lines of "You need everything temperature controlled" and more. I will also count how much it costs, because I'm curious too

Also I won't mention things that are more general like tweezers, digital multimeter (Those 2 need to be sharp, the multimeter probes too), solder wick etc. Because there are hardly "bad" such products, but I also use them

1. Soldering iron: KSGER T12, 270zł

- I heard it's sometimes inside really bad quality components and it explodes, not mine, works for many years, inside looks good enough
- The smallest available soldering tip, obviously
- The coil of it beeps, I dislike beeps

2. Hot air: YIHUA 858d, 110zł

- You might able to use the hotplate to replace the hot air, but not the other way

4. Hot plate: MECHANIC IX5 ULTRA, 100zł

- Used to solder the esp32c6, the bma acc and the mcp23018 (mcp23018 is managable by soldering iron but me lazy), I couldn't do the esp32c6 with hot air, maybe the rest is managable with it
- Before it I used a soviet era break cooker. I'm not joking. It was very hot, somehow everything worked fine:

5. Solder: Cynel proffesional Sn60Pb40, 30zł

![Cyna-100g-Cynel-0-5mm-z-Topnikiem-SN60PB40-SW26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daffdac0-ab23-48c1-82ac-a9d5e30cd813)

- The thinnest one, 0.5mm I think
- I love this solder and you should too, it has a bit of flux in it so it makes everything so much easier. It also has lead, that also helps (no it's not scary, educate yourself further, no, Yatchy is not created by a company so it's not banned for this use case)

6. Flux: BTFO-81-1BROQUETAS, 20zł

![obraz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b6145a3-ce6a-40da-8642-ecb47278cd7d)

- Here idk if it's really the best at this price point, it just works for me
- Once I tried a fluid flux, there is no coming back

7. Flux pen: KESTER 951, 20 zł

![obraz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f62fd3c6-fe8f-40cf-a7f0-db31c29b0fc6)

- Usefull for hot plate soldering (where not so much flux is wanted)

8. Microscope: Those cheapest ones out there, no model, 40zł

![obraz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06aaba03-8982-4332-a1cb-eac3264bc170)

- It's just so much better to solder with one, yes I'm blind
- I added TVS diodes and capacitors for it to not break suddenly like the last one, expensive one
- They are all shit quality up to 50$ so the cheapest one is fine anyway.

Sum: 690 zł, 182$, could be worse
