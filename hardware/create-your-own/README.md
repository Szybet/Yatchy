# Viewing the PCB & schematic
It's available [here](https://szybet.github.io/Yatchy/hardware/read-only/index.html) but I advice using kicad directly anyway, as this site could be outdated

## Binner.io
~~I started using Binner.io, if you want to manage your Yatchy parts in it, [here](https://github.com/Szybet/Yatchy/blob/main/hardware/BinnerParts.xlsx) is the export with all the parts. Yes, it could be outdated.~~ Don't use it: https://github.com/replaysMike/Binner/issues/397 :(
