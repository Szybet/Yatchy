# Assembling Yatchy
There are 2 ways to solder a Yatchy (in a reasonable way):
- Solderimg manually:
  - Allows for bigger control over the process, allows for more debugging capabilities, more testing options (I will explain it below)
  - Takes more time
  - Cheaper
- Via a stencil
  - Less debugging options, less testing options, less control of what's going on (which doesn't mean it's not possible, simply compared to manually)
  - Faster
  - More expensive

As for the skill level required, yh, idk, both are hard, here you solder everything manually but in stencil you need to repair things that didn't go well, so idk, decide for yourself

In this guide I will focus on manual, but also say from time to time things specific to stencil. If you use stencil for soldering many yatchies, you should still solder at least one manually to understand what is going on.

Things like:
- Equipment I use, or is needed
- What soldering skills are needed
- Where to view the PCB and schematic (while soldering, you should probably open it to know which components to grab)

Are discussed in other files. I will not link them, as you should read everything anyway, so there are no suprises later.

# Yatchy "sections"
Yatchy (as any other electronic device really) consists of sections. Some depend on each other, the point is you pretty much can't (and shouldn't) (until you have the skill and knowledge to know what you are doing) debug things when soldering half of them. Also don't power the device when half of it is soldered. Things may simply not work or just damage itself (rarely)
